Hi all, this is my first repository on GitHub and I would like to help you understand the C programming language with some "easy" exercises.

My configuration:
Code::Blocks 20.03 + MinGW-W64 project compiler v.12.2.0 (https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#mingw-builds)

Feel free to use my code.

(Something is written in italian but you can easily translate it and start learning a new language)
